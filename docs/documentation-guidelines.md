# Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

This guide outlines our standards for creating clear, concise, and useful documentation. Well-structured documentation helps team members, new developers, and even AI assistants understand our codebase and processes more effectively.

## Documentation Structure

### File Organization

1. **Root README.md**: Contains project overview, quick start guide, and links to detailed documentation
2. **docs/ directory**: Houses detailed documentation organized by topic
3. **Component-level documentation**: Specific implementation details belong in relevant directories

### When to Split vs. Combine Documentation

- **Split documentation when**:
  - The topic exceeds 500 lines
  - It covers distinct functional areas
  - Different audiences need different sections
  
- **Combine documentation when**:
  - Topics are closely related
  - The combined document remains under 500 lines
  - Information naturally flows together

## Document Format

### Every Document Should Include

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive heading
2. **Overview/Introduction**: Brief explanation of the topic (1-3 sentences)
3. **Body Content**: Organized with proper headings and subheadings
4. **Examples**: Code samples or use cases
5. **Related Resources**: Links to other relevant documents

### Markdown Conventions

- Use heading levels appropriately (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
- Use code blocks with language specification for all code examples: ```javascript
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Use tables for structured data or comparisons
- Use blockquotes for important notes or warnings

## Writing Style

### General Principles

1. **Be concise**: Use simple sentences and avoid unnecessary words
2. **Be specific**: Prefer concrete examples over abstract explanations
3. **Use active voice**: "Install the package" instead of "The package should be installed"
4. **Address the reader directly**: Use "you" rather than "the user"
5. **Use present tense**: "The function returns a value" not "The function will return a value"

### Technical Terminology

- Define terms on first use
- Link to glossaries or external resources for complex terms
- Be consistent with terminology throughout documentation

## Examples and Code Snippets

### Effective Examples

- Start with simple use cases before complex ones
- Show both the code and its output when relevant
- Include comments to explain non-obvious parts
- Use real-world scenarios that developers can relate to

### Code Snippet Best Practices

```javascript
// Example of a well-documented code snippet
/**
 * Fetches user data from the API
 * @param {number} userId - The ID of the user to fetch
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} User data object
 */
async function fetchUser(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to fetch user ${userId}:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usage
const user = await fetchUser(123);
console.log(user.name); // Outputs: "Jane Doe"
```

## Cross-Linking Documents

### When to Link

- Link to other documents when referencing related concepts
- Link to external resources for industry standards or dependencies
- Link to API reference when mentioning specific functions or classes

### How to Link

- Use relative links for internal documentation: `[Authentication](../auth/authentication.md)`
- Use descriptive link text: "See [Authentication Guide](../auth/authentication.md)" not "Click [here](../auth/authentication.md)"
- For external links, include the site name: "[MDN Web Docs: JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)"

## Documentation Maintenance

### Keeping Docs Current

- Update documentation when code changes
- Add "Last Updated" dates to documents
- Review documentation regularly (at least quarterly)
- Remove outdated documentation rather than letting it become stale

### Documentation Reviews

- Have peers review documentation changes
- Consider both technical accuracy and clarity
- Get feedback from new team members to identify gaps

## Optimizing for AI and Search

- Use clear headings and consistent formatting
- Include relevant keywords naturally within the text
- Organize content hierarchically with proper Markdown heading levels
- Use tables of contents for longer documents
- Avoid embedding critical information only in images (add alt text and descriptions)

## Special Documentation Types

### API Documentation

- Document all public methods, parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Include authentication requirements
- Provide request and response examples

### Tutorial Documentation

- Use a step-by-step format with numbered lists
- Include screenshots for UI-related steps
- Clearly state prerequisites
- Estimate completion time

### Troubleshooting Guides

- Organize by specific error messages or symptoms
- Include causes and solutions
- Provide verification steps to confirm resolution

## Sample Documentation Template

```markdown
# [Component/Feature Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the component or feature.

## Prerequisites
What the user needs before using this component/feature.

## Installation/Setup
Step-by-step instructions.

## Basic Usage
Simple examples covering common use cases.

## Advanced Usage
More complex examples for power users.

## API Reference
Detailed description of functions, parameters, etc.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions.

## Related Resources
Links to related documentation.
```

By following these guidelines, you'll create documentation that is accessible, usable, and maintainable for both human developers and AI assistants.
